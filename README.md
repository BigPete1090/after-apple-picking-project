This is my project I made for my American Studies II class, based on the Robert Frost poem "After Apple-Picking". I wanted to respond to the poem since its flow and story was very intresting, as it seems to be a long train of thought. I was interested by the way the narrarator describes the apple-picking, when due to fatigue, they see "magnified apples appear and disappear" (Frost 18). I wanted to recreate this scene in the best way I knew how, coding. I used the coding language Python and pygame, a Python graphics interface, to create different frames of changing an apple orchard scene and adding magnifying apples falling. I stretch, blur, and enhance the color, all while letting more apples fall, to try to remake the dream-like state the narrarator in Frost's poem was in based on my interpretation of the poem. It is a creative visualization of what I imagine the narrator seeing after overexerting themselves when apple picking. Below is my gif that I ended up creating, though it can only be seen once because the readme does not support looping gifs.
